**Unit 7: Politics and the Harlem Renaissance** <span id="7"></span> 
*African American modernism, often referred to as the Harlem
Renaissance, is crucial to the history of modernist poetry. Starting in
the 1920s and 30s, Harlem Renaissance poets like Langston Hughes,
Countee Cullen, and Jessie Redmon Fauset wrote poems that explored the
African American experience and the challenges of modernity. Poems from
the Harlem Renaissance showed concerns with grief, populist ideas, and
pride and celebration of African American heritage and culture. The
poems focused on intellectualism, explored free verse, and aimed to
strengthen the voice of the speaker.* *In later years, writers like
Gwendolyn Brooks, Margaret Walker, and Robert Hayden created new poetic
forms in dialogue with both the Harlem Renaissance and broader
developments in American and African American culture.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will explore African American modernist poetry, and
you will analyze its development, its unique features, and how these
poems achieved (or attempted to achieve) certain political aims. As you
study the poets and poems in this unit, consider how the themes and
poetic devices used during the Harlem Renaissance fit into the modernist
idea of making something new. Also, consider how culture and politics
transformed the movement.*
