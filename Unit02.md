*Now that you have a good sense of the conventions and assumptions that
the modernists resisted, we will turn our attention to the French
Symbolists in this unit. *By studying the material in this unit, you
will be able to answer questions about the relationship between
Anglo-American modern poetry of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and the
French Symbolist poetry of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. You will be able
to distinguish the avant-garde poetic experiments of three of the best
known poets of this movement: Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud, and
Stéphane Mallarmé. You will also be able to recognize how those
experiments became the fountainhead of modernism.**

    object, picture, written word, or sound, which represents something
    else by association, resemblance, or convention. Recall from “A
    Brief Guide to Symbolists” in subunit 2.1: “The ‘symbols’ for which
    they are named are emblems of the actual world – as opposed to the
    purely emotional world which dominates their work – that accumulate
    supernatural significance in the absence of a clear narrative or
    location.”  
        
     As you read these poems, consider the ways in which Rimbaud use
    symbols and/or symbolic language to engage his readers. Identify the
    symbols used by Rimbaud, and write down all of associations that
    they elicit in your mind.  
      
     Studying these poems and completing the activity described above
    should take approximately 2 hours.
