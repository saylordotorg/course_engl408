**Unit 8: Poetic Responses to World War II, the Holocaust, and the
Global Nuclear Threat** <span id="8"></span> 

*In this unit, you will take a look at World War II poetry, keeping in
mind the representation of war and violence we encountered in the World
War I poems so as to compare and contrast these eras of poetry and the
approach to the war poem. Consider whether the WWII poems more
accurately address the realities of war. The question to consider in
this unit and one that modernist poets toward the end of the movement
sought to address is: *“Are the horrors of the World Wars, multiple
genocides, and threat of nuclear incineration of cities and potentially
the entire planet so monumental that they can only become trivialized by
being spoken about as expository narrative or re-interpreted as
art?”**  
  

*In this unit, you will study poetry that responded to World War II, the
Holocaust, Japanese-American internment, and the Atomic Age. This unit
will introduce you to World War II poets like Randall Jarrell, Keith
Douglas, and Karl Shapiro as well as Japanese internment poets like*
*Violet Kazue de Cristoforo.*
