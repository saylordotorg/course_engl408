**Unit 6: High Modernism** <span id="6"></span> 
*The literary aesthetic of* High Modernism*,* *which represented the
ways modernity was transforming culture by experimenting with, adapting,
and altering more traditional literary styles and forms, is best
understood as a profound ambivalence about both the present and the
past.*  
    
 *Modernist poets tended toward fragmented and disjointed perspectives
rather than cohesive or coherent patterns in order to question rather
than explain and to reject the illusive order of literary artifice in a
world of relative truth rather than objective truth. Their poetic
expressions at times appear to be the free associations. A work like
Eliot’s Waste Land includes overarching patterns and echoing classical
or mythic narratives, but the allusions are foregrounded by very
personal and opaque commentary or by snapshots of interruptive images as
if a bomb had exploded a church’s stained glass window onto a city’s
dump-site.*  
    
 *The high modernist emphasis on individual experience over objective
truth ironically also meant incorporating elements of popular culture,
which had not been thought literary enough for high art until then,
mixing in colloquialisms and dialects without the aid of an interpretive
narrator. Pub diction and Dante Italian and Sanskrit swirl in word
searches for the holy grail of meaning in desiccated land and
cityscapes. The demands of high modernist style tapping into precious
and arcane cultural allusion without context or even perceived intention
guaranteed a small, very educated elite readership and fed an army of
academic explicators. Then again, less obtuse and far more commercially
successful poets like Frost and Sandburg were viewed as sell-outs to
bourgeois culture.*  
    
 *Probably the greatest irony of the high modernist poets was that the
more that they protested how* new *they were their use of highly
traditional, even ancient, poetic forms grew. Ezra Pound’s later work
providing the most obvious exemplars. This ambivalence may be best
encapsulated by the title of T. S. Eliot’s influential essay “Tradition
and the Individual Talent” and such mind-twisting statements as "No
poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His
significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to
dead poets and artists.” How that jives with Pound’s modernist mantra,
“Make it new,” is the conundrum of these poets and their critics. Hart
Crane’s “The Bridge” is probably the best example of this high modernist
merging of a deep, almost impenetrable, subjectivity with the
traditional epic form.*
