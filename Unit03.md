**Unit 3: Early Modernist Movements: Symbolism, Imagism, and Their
Relatives** <span id="3"></span> 

*From a contemporary poet’s perspective that often simplifies the
initial choice of directions between formalist *verse *such as Dylan
Thomas' famous villanelle “Do not go gentle into that good night” and*
free verse *such as e.e. cummings’ “spring is like a perhaps / Hand in a
window,” the existence of so many, often contentious movements, in
modern poetry (1900–1960) seems peculiar. What may be even stranger is
that almost every movement is backed by a revolutionary manifesto,
arguing that movement’s greater understanding of the true nature or
purpose of its brand of poetry, published in its own special journal.*  
    
 *Jeanine Johnson in her book, *Why Write Poetry?: Modern Poets
Defending Their Art, *attempts to sum up the rationale behind the
plethora of poetic movements that sprung up throughout the
20<sup>th</sup> century:*

   
 *“Pope and Tennyson could assume, in a way that Eliot and Pound could
not, that the interpretive equipment their readers brought to their
poems was more or less adequate and therefore, the modern poets wrote
manifestoes and critical prose in unprecedented quantities to try to
communicate to readers the principles at work behind their poems. . . .
Many of these manifestoes promoted a particular type of or approach to
poetry. These were defences of imagism, vorticism, futurism, and
objectivism; of the Fugitives and neo-symbolists; of an authentic
“Negro” or African-American literature as envisioned in a certain way by
Langston Hughes in Fire!! (1926), and in other ways by later authors
such as Amiiri Baraka and Audre Lorde; of Projective Verse and of the
works of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets; of Beat poetry and of feminist
confessional poetry.”*  
   
 *In this unit, we will consider an extensive sampling of some of these
movements, including Symbolism and Imagism. We will discuss other
movements, such as the more radical movements of Futurism, Vorticism,
Objectivism, and High Modernism, in greater detail in Units 3, 5, and 6
of this course, metaphorically interrupted by Unit 4’s coverage of the
most defining event of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, World War I.*  
  

*This unit opens with a comparison of Symbolism to Victorian era poetry.
This unit will discuss the incorporation of Symbolism into modern
British poetic expression, such as with W.B. Yeats, and American poetic
expressions, such as with Wallace Stevens, and will then turn to the
various other “–isms” that were cultivated in the early 1900s, examining
their poetics, practices, and concerns.This unit attempts to define
Imagism and then continues to explore Imagism and its sister poetic
movements with names like Amygism as well as Movement and Stasis.
Imagism is the name given to a movement in poetry, originating in 1912
and represented by Ezra Pound, Amy Lowell, Hilda Doolittle (H.D.),
Wallace Stevens, Richard Aldington, F.S. Flint, John Gould Fletcher,
Harriet Monroe, Marianne Moore, and others. Imagism aims at clarity of
expression through the use of precise visual images. In the early
period, the word was often written in the French form Imagisme as an
extension of the practice of the 19<sup>th</sup> century French
Symbolists studied in Unit 2.*

    Nautilus”](http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-paper-nautilus/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Moore’s poems: “A Grave,” “An Octopus,”
    “Silence,” and “The Paper Nautilus.” Note that Moore often used
    syllabics, the counting of syllables as a form of meter, rather than
    typical metrical lines; a strong example of the use of syllabics is
    “The Fish.”  
        
     Take some time to note the characteristics of Imagism and modernism
    found in Moore’s poetry. Choose one or two of Moore’s poems to
    analyze. Consider the effects that Moore tries to achieve, and write
    a few paragraphs that explain your interpretation, using examples
    from the poem to support your ideas. Consider posting your written
    response to the [ENGL408 Course Discussion
    Board](http://forums.saylor.org/forum/english/ENGL408/), and respond
    to other students’ posts.  
        
     Studying these poems and completing the writing activity should
    take approximately 3 hours.
