Course Syllabus for "ENGL408: Modern Poetry and Poetics"
---------------------------------------------------------

The decades between roughly 1890 and 1960 witnessed unprecedented
efforts to create new art, new values, and a new culture in Europe and
the United States to distance itself from the more socially acceptable
works of late Victorian poets and artists. During this time, Western
writers, artists, and intellectuals questioned the accepted aesthetic
norms and produced radically experimental works of art and new
understandings of what it means to live in modern times. The first half
of the 20<sup>th</sup> century also witnessed the most devastating
conflicts in Western history – the two World Wars and the Holocaust –
and these events accelerated and profoundly influenced cultural changes.
Modernist poetry – one of the most interesting cultural developments –
emerged during this time. While it is true that modernist poetic
developments sprang up in unlikely and seemingly spontaneous ways, we
will attempt to progress through this course in a roughly chronological
manner. This is because, in many ways, even modern poetry retains a
social form that can reflect the cultural and political situations in
which it is written. The course starts with a theoretical consideration
of modernity and modernism, as well as a brief introduction to poetics
and some references to pre-modern Victorian poetic practices. This
course then explores transitional, fin-de-siècle poetic innovations of
the French symbolists and World War I poets. The course addresses early
modernist movements like Imagism, Vorticism, and Futurism as well as the
writings of High Modernism. A unit on African-American modernism, often
referred to as the Harlem Renaissance, explores another crucial
dimension. Finally, you will analyze how World War II and the Holocaust
affected poetry. By the end of the course, you will have studied the
work of major American and British modernist poets, and you will have
critically explored the characteristic techniques, concerns, and tropes
of modern poetry.   *The Course’s Grand Design* **<span
style="text-decoration: underline;">Two Bridges to Modernity</span>
Think of this course in terms of two bridges. The shorter bridge is the
main subject of this course, or modern poetry in a certain time period,
being from the relative orderliness of the late 19<sup>th</sup> century
(i.e., Victorian era) to the chaotic end of World War II and the
potentialities for world-wide nuclear annihilation during the early
1960’s. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Longer
Bridge</span> The longer cultural bridge is the overarching
philosophical paradigm shift to modernity, **** marked in literary terms
on one end by John Milton’s 1674 *Paradise Lost* [Note: The best website
for all of Milton’s poetry is [The John Milton Reading
Room](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/contents/index.shtml)at
Dartmouth.] and on the other end by William Carlos Williams’ 1923 “The
Red Wheelbarrow.” The really big question in this course is how did
Western culture come from Milton’s confident “justifying the ways of God
to men” in his epic poem: *Of Man’s First Disobedience, and the Fruit Of
that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal taste Brought* [Death into the World,
and all our
woe](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/pl/book_1/notes.shtml#_blank)*,
With loss of Eden, till* [one greater
Man](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/pl/book_1/notes.shtml#_blank)
*Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat, Sing* [Heav'nly
Muse](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/pl/book_1/notes.shtml#_blank)*,
that on the secret top Of*
[Oreb](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/pl/book_1/notes.shtml#_blank)*,
or of Sinai, didst inspire That Shepherd, who first taught the* [chosen
Seed](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/pl/book_1/notes.shtml#_blank)*,*
[In the
Beginning](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/pl/book_1/notes.shtml#_blank)
*how the Heav'ns and Earth Rose* [out of
Chaos](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/pl/book_1/notes.shtml#_blank)*:
. . .* to barely being able to hang on to the existence of reality
itself with William Carlos Williams’ poem? *so much depends* *upon* *a
red wheel barrow* *glazed with rain water* *beside the white chickens*
“So much depends” on what, Mr. Williams? Milton explained in gargantuan
detail what depended on Adam’s tasting of the forbidden fruit, while
William Carlos Williams leaves us with a 16 word enigma about a
wheelbarrow and chickens. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
Shorter Bridge</span> The shorter bridge that this course on the
*modern* represents is the one that connects the Victorian ** period to
the start of our *contemporary* **** artistic endeavors. The one that
begins near Tennyson’s “Into the valley of death rode the 6,000” and
ends with the advent of the Beat poets with Ginsberg’s “Howl”: “dragging
themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix.”
Ginsberg's “Howl” in so many ways registers the culmination of the wars
and the beginning of *self-absorbed, contemporary* poetry, which would
be the subject for a subsequent course. The main goal of this course is
to show you the functioning of that shorter bridge. Hart Crane
visualized it both concretely and metaphorically. For him, it was the
“Brooklyn Bridge” itself. For me, it is the term *modern.* On her death
bed, Gertrude Stein’s last words expressed modern art’s **** continuing
efforts to express the inexpressible in our center-less universe. “What
is the answer?” she asked, and when no answer came she laughed and said:
“Then, what is the question?” We will hear a number of 20<sup>th</sup>
century poets try to explore these questions throughout this course.

### Learning Outcomes

online materials. However, it makes primary use of the following
materials:

-   Yale University: Professor Langdon Hammer’s [“Modern
    Poetry”](http://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-310) Lectures
-   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign: English Department’s
    [“Modern American
    Poetry”](http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/index.htm)
-   University of Pennsylvania: Dr. Al Filreis’ [“Modern and
    Contemporary American
    Poetry”](http://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/home.html)

**Requirements for Completion:**In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
You will also need to complete:

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
study all of the resources and analyze the poems in this course.  
  
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again as many
times as you wish.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **144.75
hours** to complete. You will have unlimited access to the course and
can approach the course in any way that you deem appropriate for your
learning style and other time commitments. The course is projected over
a traditional 15 week semester, so you may choose to do it in this time
frame, or you may take less time or more time. Each unit includes a time
advisory that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each
subunit. These should help you plan your time. It may be useful to take
a look at these advisories, to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take approximately 12.5 hours to
complete. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunits 1.1 through 1.2.2 (a total of 4.25 hours) on Monday
night; subunits 1.2.3 through 1.2.5 (a total of 4.5 hours) on Tuesday
night; subunit 1.3 (a total of 3.75 hours) on Wednesday night; etc.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions: **As you study the poems in this course, keep in
mind that it may help to read each poem on the page as well as out loud.
This course covers a wide variety of literary styles; therefore, it is
essential to keep careful notes as you study. Write down the names of
any style, movement, poet, literary conventions used by that poet, and
interpretations you have about the poem. Review your notes from previous
units before starting a new unit so that comparisons between the various
styles and movements of modernist poetry will be more apparent. These
notes will also be very useful as a review as you study and prepare for
your final exam.
