**Unit 1: The Province of Modern Poetry** <span id="1"></span> 
*This course will attempt to snake its way chronologically through the
poetry produced in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century under
the literary banner of modernism. In Unit 1, we will begin by defining
modernism and reviewing the poetry and poets that preceded modern poetry
in the Victorian era.* *With the objective of defining modernism in
mind, we will explore what modern is NOT – that is, you will explore
those 19<sup>th</sup>-century assumptions and conventions that modern
poets sought to dissociate themselves from and the socio-historical
context in which they had developed. This unit contains a sampler of the
Victorian-era establishment-approved poets – Alfred, Lord Tennyson,
Rudyard Kipling, Matthew Arnold, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and John
Greenleaf Whittier – that the modernist poets so self-consciously
rebelled against. The modernist poets also rebelled against those
societies that produced World War I, World War II, and the Cold War.*  
    
 *Fortunately, the most familiar American poet, Robert Frost, emerged at
the beginning of the modernist movement. Frost is the poet that
Professor Langdon Hammer first chooses to introduce in his “Modern
Poetry” course at Yale University. *The unit will lead into an
introduction of modern poets through a study of Robert Frost.* Finally,
this unit will conclude with a general discussion of characteristic
modernist concerns as they tend to be defined by scholars.*
