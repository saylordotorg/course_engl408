**Unit 5: Other Modernist Movements: Futurism, Vorticism, and
Objectivism** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will study a sampling of the manifestos behind the
poetry of three competing poetic movements from the 1910s to 1930s:
Futurism, Vorticism, and Objectivism. This unit will work to define and
characterize these movements. Futurism, often associated with
Marinetti’s* Manifesto of Futurism, *was an artistic and social movement
that aimed to reject traditional forms of art (i.e., for poetry,
rejecting the rules that govern prosody) and focused on imagery as well
as precision. Futurist poets highlighted concepts of the future and
developed a new language with the play of syntax and alternative
substitutions for meter, in the traditional sense. Vorticism, first
introduced by Pound’s essay “Vortex” in* BLAST, *was inspired by Cubism
as well as embraced the focus on the mechanical age presented in
Futurism. Vorticism focused on abstraction and typographical
exploration, and it aimed to capture movement and stillness within an
image. In 1930, Objectivism was coined by William Carlos Williams; in
consideration of writing, he described this as having “a special eye to
its structural aspects, how it has been constructed.…” This concept was
expanded on by Louis Zukofsky, who reluctantly pioneered Objectivism at
Harriet Monroe’s request to give a name to his associated group of
poets. In response to Monroe, Zukofsky said, “No, some of us are writing
to say things simply so that they will affect us as new again.” The
Objectivist agenda, as defined by Zukofsky, aimed for simplicity and
clarity, attempted to create something new, and treated a poem as an
object. As you study the material in this unit, consider how these
movements compare and contrast to the rhetorical aim of Imagism.*
