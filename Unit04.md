**Unit 4: Poetry of World War I and Its Aftermath** <span
id="4"></span> 
*While poets experimented with new poetic forms and styles, Europe was
consumed by war. In this unit, you will chart the progression of
attitudes toward the war as expressed through poetry, beginning with the
patriotic verses of the early war years and continuing through some of
the bitterer, disillusioned lyrical poems of the late war years. You
will study changes in form, tone, and style, all the while noting the
degree to which the war’s major poets adhered to traditional
(19<sup>th</sup>-century) conventions and hypothesizing reasons for that
allegiance despite the explosion of avant-garde trends. In this unit,
you will study poems by Siegfried Sassoon, Rupert Brooke, Wilfred Owen,
Rudyard Kipling, and e.e. cummings.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 18.5 hours.
